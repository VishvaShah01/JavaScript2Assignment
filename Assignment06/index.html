            While travelling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand requests Bajirao's help to fight invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of the Hindu Rajput king Chhatrasal and his Persian Muslim consort Ruhani Begum. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists Bajirao to spend Holi with them. Mastani and Bajirao fall in love during this time and he gives her his dagger, unaware that it is a symbol of marriage among the Rajputs. Back home in Pune, Kashibai greets Bajirao with a tour of their newly built Shaniwar Wada and the Aaina Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), which allows her to see him from her room.<br>
            Determined to pursue her love, Mastani arrives in Pune but is treated harshly by Bajirao's mother Radhabai and accommodated in the palace for courtesans, as Radhabai refuses to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Mastani tolerates this and adamantly expresses her desire to be with Bajirao; Bajirao chides in her persistence, reminding her he is already married and will never fully be hers; his court will also never respect her. Mastani agrees to these conditions so Bajirao declares her his second wife.<br>

After Bajirao receives the news, he singlehandedly defeats Nasir Jung's army in his rage but is fatally injured.

            The film is based on the real-life story of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.<br>
            A reporter named Alka meets Amol Dwivedi, the creator of a foundation for acid attack survivors, and informs him about Laxmi Agarwal, one such survivor fighting for a ban on the sale of acid. Laxmi is looking for employment, and Amol employs her at his organization.<br>
            In April 2005, Laxmi is attacked with acid in a busy market street in New Delhi. The police investigate – based on Laxmi's and her boyfriend Rajesh's testimony, they suspect Basheer "Babbu" Khan, a family friend of Malti's, and his brother's wife Parveen Shaikh. The police arrest Babbu after triangulating his phone signal in the same area as the attack, while Laxmi undergoes a series of surgeries to reconstruct her severely damaged face. Laxmi's parents work as domestic help in Shiraz's house; she helps financially with Laxmi's treatment and hires Archana Bajaj to be her lawyer.<br>
            It is revealed that Basheer planned the acid attack on Laxmi in jealousy, and carried it out with help from Parveen. In October 2013, the Delhi High Court rejects Basheer's appeal, keeping the attackers in jail. The film ends with another acid attack in December 2013, and laments that despite the new regulations and media exposure, the frequency of acid attacks has not decreased, while acid is still bought and sold freely in India.

            Piku Banerjee (Deepika Padukone) is a Bengali architect residing in Delhi with her 70-year-old widowed father, Bhashkor (Amitabh Bachchan). Bhashkor is a hypochondriac with chronic constipation, who traces every problem to his bowel movements. His habits often lead to quarrels with Piku, the servants (Bodan), and Chhobi Mashi (Moushumi Chatterjee), Piku's maternal aunt, who often visits them. Piku loves her father and, as her mother is deceased, takes good care of him but is often extremely irritated by his eccentricities. Her colleague, Syed Afroz (Jisshu Sengupta) is a good friend, and she is a regular client of Syed's friend, Rana Chaudhary's (Irrfan Khan) taxi business. Regularly stressed both by her job and by her father's finicky behavior, Piku often quarrels with Rana's taxi drivers during her morning commute, leading to several car crashes.<br>
            The next day, everyone discovers that Bhashkor has died in his sleep, probably from sleep apnea or cardiac arrhythmia. Piku states that he always wanted a peaceful death. She returns to Delhi, where she arranges his funeral. There, Dr. Srivastava (Raghubir Yadav), Bhashkor's doctor, reveals to her that Syed, too, has constipation and Bhashkor knew about it for a long time. A few days later, she pays up whatever due she owes Rana. She renames the Delhi house "Bhaskor Villa" in her father's memory and the maid, who had left due to Bhashkor's tantrums, returns to work. The film ends with a scene of Piku playing badminton with Rana in the courtyard in front of her house.
